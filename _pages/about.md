Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Psychology](https://dornsife.usc.edu/psyc/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). 

I received a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and Linguistics from University of California, Los Angeles in 2018. After graduation, I joined the [USC Language Development Lab](https://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/langdevlab) as a PhD student under the guidance of [Toby Mintz](https://dornsife.usc.edu/tobenmintz). 

My research focuses on topics related to language acquisition and the cognitive mechanisms associated with the process: how infants acquire fundamental syntactic knowledge about the language that they are learning, how environmental input affects the mechanism underlying this learning process, what are the constraints for infants and adults to learn statistical patterns from visual and auditory input, etc. 

I was born and raised in [Shenzhen, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen), and I adopted two cats, Ephesus and FatChoy (photos [here](https://www.instagram.com/effortlessephesus/)).

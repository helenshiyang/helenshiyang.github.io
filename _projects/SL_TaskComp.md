In the realm of cognitive science, understanding how we measure learning is paramount. Our ongoing project seeks to critically evaluate and compare two prevalent behavioral measures: the 'two-alternative forced choice' and the 'familiarity rating'. Think of it like comparing two different thermometers to see which one gives the most accurate reading. One method asks participants to make a choice between two options, while the other asks them how familiar something feels. 

Each method has its merits, but their efficacy in truly capturing participants' learning outcomes can vary. By contrasting these measures, we aim to shed light on their respective strengths and potential limitations. As the project progresses, our findings will provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field.

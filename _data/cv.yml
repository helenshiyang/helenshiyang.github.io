    - title:  Human dynamic actions aid non-adjacent dependency learning in both infants and adults

      description:
        - "Prior research shows robust learning of adjacent dependencies in humans across different modalities, whereas learning nonadjacent dependencies (NADs; the co-occurrence of a and b in aXb) is more constrained and often requires support from particular properties of the stimulus. We report nine behavioral experiments that examined adults’ and infants’ NAD learning from various types of visual stimuli. We found that for adults, depictions of dynamic action (involving non-human objects) and static images of human agents independently aid NAD learning, with sequences of dynamic human action providing the strongest learning signal. Similarly, we found that when visually habituated to a human agent performing a sequence of actions, 9- month-olds successfully learned adjacent and non-adjacent repetition rules (e.g., ABB and ABA). They also learned NADs embedded in visual sequences depicting human dynamic actions, the earliest age that infants have been shown to learn visual NADs. Taking together the results from our adult and infant experiments, we speculate that human dynamic actions constitute a robust stimulus domain for sequential pattern learning because they enrich memory representations. Richer representations could then result in better recall, and provide a stronger signal for NAD learning."

      description: "Seven-month-olds can learn simple repetition patterns, such as we-fo-we (ABA) or we-fo-fo (ABB), and generalize these rules to sequences of new syllables. While 7-month-olds can learn repetition rules from visual sequences of communicative stimuli, even eleven-month-olds fail to learn non-adjacent ABA rules in sequences of shapes. Some researchers thus claim that sequential rule learning applies preferentially to communicative stimuli. Yet here we show that when visually habituated to a human avatar performing a sequence of non-communicative actions, 9-month-olds can learn adjacent and non-adjacent repetition rules. We also show that infants can learn more complex dependency patterns: item-specific non-adjacent dependencies (AmXiBm; henceforth iNADs) with similar stimuli. While prior behavioral research suggests that infants younger than 15 months have difficulty learning iNADs in spoken artificial languages, our results show that prelingual infants have the computational capacity for learning iNADs, consistent with neurophysiological data. The difficulty to elicit robust behavioral evidence of iNAD learning in other domains may result from limitations on memory. We propose that dynamic human actions constitute a particularly robust stimulus domain for sequential pattern learning because it results in richer memory representations, in part through activation of motor representations. Stimuli perceived as communicative may serve similar role by boosting attention and thereby enhancing sequence memory. Thus, we provide new evidence and a different hypothesis for infants’ learning of non-adjacent repetition rules, and the first behavioral evidence of iNAD learning in 9-month-olds."
